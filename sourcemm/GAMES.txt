Metamod: Source generally tries to support all Source engine based games. However, some API features
may only be supported by some games. This does not mean these features will not work on
games not listed here, but that games listed here are specifically known and tested to work.

The only Source-based game completely unsupported by Metamod:Source is Dark Messiah.
