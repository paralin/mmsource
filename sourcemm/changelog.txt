2005/12/06 1.1.2:
 - Added interface overriding/sharing examples to sample plugins.
 - Added API to help guessing at Valve interface versions.
 - Fixed various memory leaks.
 - Fixed memory corruption bug on vector copying.
 - Fixed other various template bugs.

2005/10/21 1.1.1:
 - Fixed a bug where AllPluginsLoaded() was not called after DLLInit().

2005/10/21 1.1:
 - Rewrote GameDLL loading code to be API version generic.
   As such, SourceMM will now easily support new API releases without
   an SDK release, such as the case with Day of Defeat:Source
 - Added more flexibility to plugin control by supplying an event system.
 - Removed dependency on libstdc++.so by supplying a small template library.
 - SourceHook internal API is now interface-based, meaning that future
   updates to the API will not break older plugins.  This update, however,
   breaks older plugins.
 - SourceHook is now re-entrant.
 - Added a basic automated installer (by Basic-Master).
 - Fixed a bug where games with changing game names would not work.
 - Fixed various bugs, including a cvarlist corruption bug on unloading plugins.

2005/07/07 1.00-RC2:
 - Added API for dealing with ConCommandBase registration (cvars/concmds).
    This is to fix the fact that Valve API provides no way to unlist a cvar/cmd.
 - Added two new commands - "meta cmds" and "meta cvars".
 - Added API calls for correctly printing to the console such that rcon
    will also receive messages that a plugin prints.
    This problem was mentioned on hlcoders and Valve offered no reply.
 - Added event hooking and cvar samples to sample_mm.
 - Added new cvar, mm_pluginsfile, which defaults to "addons/metamod/metaplugins.ini".  
 - Fixed a bug where multiple vtable patches on the same hook were not re-patched when removed.
    This caused a crash when two hooks were declared on one function, the first was removed, and
    the original function was then called.
 - Fixed "meta clear" not unloading all plugins.
 - Fixed Metamod:Source loading plugins with a higher current API version.
 - Fixed whitespace being parsed in metaplugins.ini.
 - Fixed bug where SourceHook tried to patch already destroyed/unavailable memory.
 - Bumped Plugin API version to 6.

2005/05/06 1.00-RC1:
 - Initial release.
