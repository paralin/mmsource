2005/06/xx 1.00-RC2:
 - Added API for dealing with ConCommandBase registration (cvars/concmds).
    This is to fix the fact that Valve API provides no way to unlist a cvar/cmd.
 - Added two new commands - "meta cmds" and "meta cvars".
 - Added API calls for correctly printing to the console such that rcon
    will also receive messages that a plugin prints.
    This problem was mentioned on hlcoders and Valve offered no reply.
 - Added event hooking and cvar samples to sample_mm.
 - Bumped API version to 6.
 - Fixed "meta clear" not unloading all plugins.
 - Fixed Metamod:Source loading plugins with a higher current API version.

2005/05/06 1.00-RC1:
 - Initial release.
