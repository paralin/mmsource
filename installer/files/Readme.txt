In this folder should be server.dll and server_i486.so.

How you prepare a release:
1) Copy the latest MM:S dlls and hl2launch.exe into this folder
2) Run Attach.exe
3) Test MMS_Installer.exe once (should work but nobody wants bug releases, especially not in the installer)
4) If everything worked fine, release it, otherwise pm me (Basic-Master)
